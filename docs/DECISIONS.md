## D001: Build Scoville in Godot 4.7.2

**Decision:** Scoville is a Godot 4.7.2 project, set up the way Clicker Lab is: a pure simulation in `src/core/`, screens that only present and report, GDScript test suites, and every Godot run through `run_godot.sh`. Phone testing uses the Web export until native builds are decided (G1).

**Why:** The same engine, scripts and habits as Clicker Lab and Number Go Up, so tools and lessons carry over. Godot also exports to iOS and Android, which the brief targets.

## D002: The brief is the design source

**Decision:** [BRIEF.md](BRIEF.md) (Hot Sauce Empire v1.0) defines the game. It replaces the first commit's port of an older HTML hot-sauce prototype, which was removed along with that prototype. Gaps in the brief become G rows in the backlog instead of silent guesses; small ones needed to build a version are assumed in that version's design doc and listed there.

**Why:** The prototype was a different design (a different loop, heat as a tap multiplier, dollars). The owner's brief is what's being built.
